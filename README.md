# Car Sales Dashboard
## Background 
You work as a data analyst at XYZ Auto, a car dealership company that sells a wide range of car models from various manufacturers.

## Task
At XYZ Auto car dealership company, we need a way to understand how well our business is performing and where we can improve. We want to have clear insights into our sales data to make informed decisions and identify areas for growth.

As a data analyst you will help in developing a dashboard that can give us a quick snapshot of our sales performance and trends. It should help us answer questions like:

- How are our sales doing compared to previous months and years?
- Are we selling more cars compared to last year, and by how much?
- What is our average selling price for cars this year, and how does it compare to last year?
- How many cars have we sold so far this year, and how does it compare to last year?
- Are there any significant changes in our sales trends that we need to be aware of?

We also need insights on:

- How are our sales trending on a weekly basis throughout the year?
- What is the distribution of our total sales across different body styles and colors of cars?
- How do our sales data vary across different dealer regions?
- How have the sales of each car manufacturer or company we work with been trending over time?

We want this dashboard to be easy to understand and navigate, even for non-technical users. It should provide visualizations that clearly show our sales performance over time and highlight any areas that require attention.

The goal is to have a tool that helps us track our progress, make data-driven decisions.
